# Build notes — decisions & things tried

Scratchpad for the build. Becomes material for the write-up post later.

## Decisions delegated by PLAN.md → my calls

- **Repo name: `agent-anatomy`.** First of the three candidates and the most
  descriptive — "anatomy" = looking inside how something works, which is the
  whole premise. `trace-theater` and `visible-agents` were the alternates.
- **Display font: Space Grotesk (variable).** Geometric with technical
  personality, pairs cleanly with IBM Plex Mono (the telemetry voice), subsets
  well for self-hosting. Body: IBM Plex Sans. Telemetry/trace text: IBM Plex Mono.
- **Prerendering approach (deferred to M5):** plan to use a minimal build-time
  HTML snapshot rather than an SSR plugin — keeps the Vite setup boring; the only
  requirement is that view-source shows the essay text. Revisit at M5.
- **Package manager: pnpm** — matches the owner's other projects.

## M0 — walking skeleton

- Vite multi-page: `index.html` (landing) + `episodes/how-an-agent-works/index.html`
  (episode), wired via `rollupOptions.input`.
- `base: "/agent-anatomy/"` in vite.config — all internal links use
  `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` so they work in dev (`/`) and on Pages (`/agent-anatomy/`).
- Tokens live in `src/styles/tokens.css` via Tailwind v4 `@theme`.
- Deploy: GitHub Actions build → Pages artifact on push to main.

### Things to verify live at M0
- [ ] Both routes reachable under `/agent-anatomy/`.
- [ ] Fonts load (self-hosted, no CDN).
- [ ] Landing → episode link works with base path.
